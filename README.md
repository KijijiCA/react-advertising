# react-advertising

A JavaScript library for display ads in [React](https://reactjs.org) applications.

**Integrate ads in your app the “React way”: by adding ad components to your JSX layout!**

* One central configuration file for all your GPT and Prebid placement config
* One provider component that handles all the “plumbing” with *googletag* and *pbjs*, nicely hidden away
* Ad slot components that get filled with creatives from the ad server when they mount to the DOM
* Works well in single page applications with multiple routes
* Suitable for server-side-rendering

[Prebid documentation](http://prebid.org/overview/intro.html) for details.
